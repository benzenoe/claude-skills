## Facebook Best Practices Reminder

- **Length:** 100-250 words performs best for text posts
- **Links:** Put in first comment to avoid algorithm penalty
- **Video:** Native video strongly preferred over YouTube links
- **Images:** High-quality, relevant visuals boost engagement
- **Timing:** Wednesday-Friday, 1-4 PM ET
- **Questions:** End with a question to drive comments
- **Engagement:** Reply to every comment to boost reach
- **Groups:** Share relevant content in business/tech groups
- **Live:** Facebook Live gets extra algorithmic boost
- **Stories:** Cross-post from Instagram for extra visibility

## Facebook vs LinkedIn

| Aspect | Facebook | LinkedIn |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Tone | More casual, personal | Professional, authoritative |
| Length | Shorter usually works | Longer form performs well |
| Stories | Yes, use them | Yes, but less engagement |
| Groups | Powerful for engagement | Less powerful |
| Video | Strong native preference | Growing importance |
| Links | First comment | In post is okay |
